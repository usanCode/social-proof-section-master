## Welcome!


## Table of contents

- [Overview](#overview)

In this challenge, we have to build a webpages about customers'opinions of a  given company's services. 
In this webpage , we have to insert a heading, a main paragraph at the top left side and,
at the top right side, we have to insert 3 different ratings.
In the middle of the webpage's body to the end there are three main blocks of the same size and background-color 
but placed at different places.

  - [The challenge](#the-challenge)

The name of the challenge is called "Social proof section". What is special in this project,
is that I have to put many elements at many different places of the webpage. 
I have to build a desktoop and a mobile versions of the webpage.

- [My process](#my-process)

For this project, I put all the elements of the webpage into a single grid container.
This container has three columns of the same size and 12 rows of different sizes.
I did this because, I had items of very different sizes to implement in it.
Another thing I had to do is to put two background-images at different positions 
of the webpage.
One background-image has to be put at the left-top side of the webpage
while the other one has to be put at the bottom right side of the webpage.
I also use the background-image-blend-mode property.
About the ratings, I put them at different grid-areas and at different margins.


  - [Built with](#built-with)

The programming languages I have used to build this project are HTML and CSS.
The editor I have chosen to use for this project is Visual Studio Code.

  - [What I learned](#what-i-learned)

Before this challenge, I was already familiar of using grid-containers. Only here, I have learned 
much about margins/paddings and what happens when the "display" property is Flex or Grid.
