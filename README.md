## Welcome!

For this project, I put all the elements of the webpage into a single grid container.
This container has three columns of the same size and 12 rows of different sizes.
I did this because, I had items of very different sizes.
Another thing I had to do is to put two background-images at different positions 
of the webpage.
One background-image has to be put at the left-top side of the webpage
while the other one has to be put at the bottom right side of the webpage.
I also use the background-image-blend-mode property.
